```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
x > load('Article for World Development (child labor).RData')

x %>% 
  select(labour1014rate) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = labour1014rate)) + geom_histogram()
 
x %>%  write_rds("final_project_1/app_data")
```

##The Question:

I will be examining if countries that are more open to trade and/or have a higher stock of foreign direct investment also have a lower incidence of child labor.
